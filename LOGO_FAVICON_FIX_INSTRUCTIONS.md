# Logo & Favicon Upload Fix - Testing Instructions

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Terms & Conditions Slug Issue ✅

-   **Problem**: Route was hardcoded to `/terms-conditions`, but slug can be changed in admin
-   **Solution**: Made route dynamic `/page/{slug}` to accept any slug
-   **Updated Files**:
    -   `routes/web.php` - Dynamic route with slug parameter
    -   `app/Http/Controllers/PageController.php` - Accepts slug parameter
    -   `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` - Footer link uses dynamic slug
    -   `resources/views/admin/settings/terms-conditions/index.blade.php` - Preview button uses dynamic slug

**Test the slug fix:**

1. Visit `/admin/settings/terms-conditions`
2. Change the slug to anything you want (e.g., "my-terms")
3. Click "Save Terms and Conditions"
4. The page should work at `/page/my-terms` (whatever slug you chose)
5. Footer link should automatically update

### 2. Enhanced Logo/Favicon Upload Debugging ✅

-   **Problem**: Form submission not working, no feedback
-   **Solution**: Added comprehensive debugging and fixed form selector

**Changes:**

-   Added `id="mainContentForm"` to the form for reliable JavaScript selection
-   Enhanced console logging with emojis for easy reading
-   Added form/button detection logging
-   Better form data logging showing files and fields
-   Loading spinner on submit button

## 🧪 TESTING STEPS

### Step 1: Clear Cache First

```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

### Step 2: Test Logo/Favicon Upload

1. **Open the admin page**: `/admin/settings/main-content`

2. **Open Browser Console**:

    - Press `F12`
    - Click on "Console" tab
    - Keep it visible

3. **Refresh the page**

    - You should see:

    ```
    Main form found: true
    Save button found: true
    ```

    **If you see "Main form found: false":**

    - Something is wrong with the page
    - Take a screenshot and share

4. **Select a Logo File**:

    - Click "Choose File" for logo
    - Select a small PNG/JPG file (< 2MB)
    - Console should show:

    ```
    Logo file selected: [filename] Size: [size] KB
    ```

5. **Select a Favicon File**:

    - Click "Choose File" for favicon
    - Select a small PNG/JPG file (< 512KB)
    - Console should show:

    ```
    Favicon file selected: [filename] Type: image/jpeg Size: [size] KB
    Selected: [filename] ([size] KB)
    ```

6. **Fill in Site Name** (required for testing):

    - Enter something in "Site Name" field
    - For example: "My Website"

7. **Click "Save Settings" Button**:

    - Button should change to show spinner and "Saving..."
    - Console should show:

    ```
    ✅ Form is being submitted...
    📋 Form fields:
      ✏️ _token: [token]
      ✏️ _method: PUT
      📎 logo: [filename] [size] bytes Type: image/png
      📎 favicon: [filename] [size] bytes Type: image/jpeg
      ✏️ site_name: My Website
    🚀 Form will now submit to server...
    ```

8. **Check what happens next**:

    **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**

    - Page should reload/redirect
    - You'll see a green success message at the top
    - Logo/favicon should appear in the "Current Logo/Favicon" section

    **IF NOTHING HAPPENS:**

    - Check Console for errors (red text)
    - Check Network tab for the POST request
    - Share the console output

### Step 3: Check Laravel Logs

Open `storage/logs/laravel.log` and look for these entries:

```
[date] local.INFO: MainContentSettings update request received {"has_logo":true,"has_favicon":true,"logo_file":"[filename]","favicon_file":"[filename]"}
```

**If you see this** = Form reached the server ✅

**Then look for:**

```
[date] local.INFO: MainContentSettings updated successfully {"logo_updated":true,"favicon_updated":true}
```

**If you see this** = Files were saved successfully ✅

**OR if you see:**

```
[date] local.WARNING: MainContentSettings validation failed {"errors":{...}}
```

**This means** = Validation error occurred ❌

-   Share the error details

## 🔍 What Console Output Tells You

### ✅ GOOD - Form Working:

```
Main form found: true
Save button found: true
Logo file selected: test.png Size: 4.52 KB
✅ Form is being submitted...
📋 Form fields:
  📎 logo: test.png 4628 bytes Type: image/png
🚀 Form will now submit to server...
```

### ❌ BAD - Form Not Found:

```
Main form found: false
❌ Main form NOT found! Check if form ID is correct.
```

**Solution**: Clear cache and refresh

### ❌ BAD - Form Not Submitting:

If you see file selected but NOT "Form is being submitted..." = JavaScript error
**Solution**: Check console for red errors

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Main form found: false"

**Cause**: Page not loaded correctly or cache issue
**Fix**:

```bash
php artisan view:clear
```

Then hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue 2: Form submits but validation fails

**Check**: `storage/logs/laravel.log` for validation errors
**Possible causes**:

-   File too large
-   Wrong file type
-   Missing required fields

### Issue 3: Form submits but files don't save

**Check**: Storage permissions

```bash
# On Linux/Mac:
chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache

# On Windows:
# Make sure storage folder is writable
```

### Issue 4: Page doesn't redirect after submit

**Check**: Network tab in browser DevTools

-   Look for POST request to `/admin/settings/main-content`
-   Check response status code
-   If 500 error = Server error (check Laravel logs)
-   If 422 error = Validation error
